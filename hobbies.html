			<h3>Video Games</h3>
			<p>I like to play video games in my free time. I have an Xbox One, which is what I play my games on. I got mine seven years ago, and am looking to upgrade
				to the Xbox Series X. However, it is in incredibly short supply. I primarily play sports games like the NHL games about ice hockey from EA and the 
				MLB The Show games from Sony. I also enjoy playing the Forza Horizon series of games, and there is a new one that is about to come out, which I am
				very excited for.</p>
