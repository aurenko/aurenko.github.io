			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Hello, welcome to my website. This website will outline some of my interests, hobbies, and other nonsense I decide to put here</p>
			<h3>Interests - Sports</h3>
			<p>I like watching sports, particularly ice hockey and baseball. My favorite teams are Philadelphia Flyers for ice hockey and the Philadelphia Phillies
				for baseball. I also like the Philadelphia Eagles and the Philadelphia 76ers, who are the city's American football and basketball teams,
				respectfully. Philadelphia also has a Major League Soccer (MLS) team called the Philadelphia Union, but I do not watch them.</p>
