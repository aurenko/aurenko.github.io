			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Hello, welcome to my website. This website will outline some of my interests, hobbies, and other nonsense I decide to put here</p>
			<h3>Interests - Sports</h3>
			<p>I like watching sports, particularly ice hockey and baseball. My favorite teams are Philadelphia Flyers for ice hockey and the Philadelphia Phillies
				for baseball. I also like the Philadelphia Eagles and the Philadelphia 76ers, who are the city's American football and basketball teams,
				respectfully. Philadelphia also has a Major League Soccer (MLS) team called the Philadelphia Union, but I do not watch them. In addition to
				Philadelphia sports, I also follow the Washington Capitals hockey team and the Washington Nationals baseball team, since they are the major league
				affiliates to minor league teams I like, the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League and the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League of AA
				Minor League Baseball.</p>
			<h3>Interests - Video Games</h3>
			<p>Lorem ipsum dolor</p>
			<h3>Interests - Cars</h3>
			<p>I really like cars. My obession with them came from my younger brothe who is also into cars. I primarily like cars from since the 1980s onward because
				I think anything before that would be too old for my taste. My dream car would be a Ford Mustang because my Grandpa on my Mom's side had one from
				the 1960s/early 1970s in a color called "Aspen Gold". He died in 1993, 12 years before I was even born, in a work accident. It was such a shame 
				because I would probably enjoy it.</p>
